# Project SecureAccessWebService

## Description
This project is a part of the course "API and Webservice" at Campus MÃ¶lndal, Sweden.
This project is a Java-based RESTful API server, configured using Maven, designed to provide CRUD functionality with a local database for data storage.
The API exposes endpoints for the client to perform CRUD operations on the database.
The API is secured using JWT tokens and the client must provide a valid token to access the endpoints.
Depending on the role of the user, the client can access different endpoints. 
CRUD operations can be performed on the user and order table by the admin, and only read and create operations can be performed by the user.
The CRUD operations can be performed on the user entity and the order entity.
